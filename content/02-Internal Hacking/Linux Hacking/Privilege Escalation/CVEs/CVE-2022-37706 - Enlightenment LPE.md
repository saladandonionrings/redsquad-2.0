# Overview
>[Enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/) is a Window Manager, Compositor, and Minimal Desktop for Linux (the primary platform), BSD, and any other compatible UNIX system. Enlightenment is classed as a “desktop shell” as it provides everything you need to operate your desktop or laptop, but it is not a full application suite. This covers functionality including launching applications, managing their windows, and performing system tasks like suspending, rebooting, managing files, and so on.
>enlightenment_sys in Enlightenment before 0.25.4 allows local users to gain privileges because it is setuid root, and the system library function mishandles pathnames that begin with a /dev/.. substring.

# Exploitation
## Detect
- Check if enlightenment is SUID root (or other) : 
```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l
```
