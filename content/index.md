This is a meticulously curated repository crafted by two dedicated young penetration testers. Our mission is to compile a comprehensive inventory of the tools, techniques, and knowledge we've amassed in the realms of cybersecurity, penetration testing, and red teaming over the recent years.

As we navigate the evolving landscape of digital security, we commit to regularly updating this Blog with fresh insights gleaned from the front lines of our professional challenges. Here, you will discover a spectrum of strategies, from foundational concepts to sophisticated methodologies, all of which have been battle-tested in our day-to-day operations and honed through countless Capture The Flag (CTF) exercises.
