# 🔑 Privacy

>[!INFO]  **Why is Online Privacy Important?**  
>Privacy is your right. 
>Technology has improved, and so have **laws** regarding internet privacy. Whenever you’re online, **websites aren’t allowed to store your private information** without your permission. In cases where your information is stored, such as on Amazon, these websites aren’t allowed to share that information with third parties.  
>Many privacy rights extend to social media. Any information posted on social media **can’t be shared without your permission** and can’t be used in any way other than what you’ve consented to. Permission is everything. Even information posted publicly is protected by you.  
>Many countries have implemented **Online Erasure**, which eliminates harmful content & digital trails. This is especially useful in protecting minors.  
>It’s your right, but you must be active in ensuring that right is enforced. Practicing your privacy rights protects you—especially online, where the concept of privacy often seems nonexistent.
