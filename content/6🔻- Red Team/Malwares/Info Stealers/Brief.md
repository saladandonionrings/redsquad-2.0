# 🕵️ InfoStealers: The Silent Data Thieves

## What Are InfoStealers?

**InfoStealers** are a class of malware designed to **silently extract sensitive data** from an infected system. Unlike ransomware, which locks files and demands payment, **InfoStealers operate covertly**, stealing data without the user’s knowledge.

🔹 **Primary Targets:**  
✅ Login credentials (**banking, emails, corporate accounts**)  
✅ **Session cookies** (to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication - MFA)  
✅ **Saved credit cards** from browsers  
✅ **Cryptocurrency wallets** (MetaMask, Exodus, Trust Wallet)  
✅ **System data** (IP address, OS, installed software, and browser history)

## How InfoStealers Work

1️⃣ **Infection** → Delivered through **phishing emails, malicious ads, cracked software, or fake browser updates.**  
2️⃣ **Data Extraction** → Steals **passwords, session cookies, crypto wallets, and more** from browsers and applications.  
3️⃣ **Exfiltration** → Sends stolen data to **cybercriminals via command & control (C2) servers.**  
4️⃣ **Exploitation** → Attackers can:

- 📛 **Sell credentials on dark web marketplaces.**
- 📌 **Hijack accounts and bypass MFA using stolen session cookies.**
- 💰 **Access banking data and drain financial accounts.**
- 🏢 **Use stolen credentials for corporate breaches and ransomware deployment.**

- [Unmasking RedLine Stealer - Idan Malihi, Medium](https://medium.com/@idan_malihi/redline-stealer-malware-analysis-76506ef723ab) - Very interesting

🔴 **RedLine is the most widely used InfoStealer**, primarily sold on underground forums and Telegram groups.
### Infection Process

1. **User downloads a fake file** (e.g., cracked software, a phishing email attachment, or a malicious ad).
2. **Stealer runs silently in the background**, avoiding detection.
3. **Steals data from browsers**, including passwords, cookies, and autofill information.
4. **Uploads stolen data to a C2 server**, where attackers can use or sell it.
5. **Hackers exploit stolen credentials** for fraud, ransomware attacks, or corporate breaches.

## ⚠️ Why Are InfoStealers So Dangerous?

🔹 **Bypass MFA** 
	**Stolen session cookies allow attackers to access accounts without needing a password or second factor.**  
🔹 **Massive Credential Leaks** 
	Data is **sold on the dark web or used in corporate breaches.**  
🔹 **Ransomware Deployment**
	Cybercriminals **use stolen VPN or corporate logins to launch ransomware attacks.**  
🔹 **Undetected for Long Periods** 
	Many victims **don’t realize they’ve been compromised until it’s too late.**
