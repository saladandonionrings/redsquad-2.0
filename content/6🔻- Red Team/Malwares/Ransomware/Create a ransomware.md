# Trojan Development Kit (TDK)

**All you need is an Android Phone.**

We can find free TDK **from hacking forums** (user-friendly interface on Android). With the app, all you need to do is **follow simple instructions**, fill out a form which has customization options and pays a one-time fee to the app developer. The customization options include choosing the kind of message you want to display on the infected device's lock screen.

**Once you do this, you can distribute the software across your test device.**

# Atom Ransomware

>[!INFO] Atom Ransomware allows you to download the software from their site. They also offer stepwise instructions on how to set it up and use it accordingly.

Download _Payloadbundle.zip_. This zipped file contains **ransomware configuration builder**, a warning note and **executable** file.

Once you download the Atom payload builder, you can start **customizing** the details immediately :

* Specify the bitcoin address you need to send to your victim
  * The price and the message that needs to be displayed
* You can also choose the directories which you need to infect, the files which can be locked and the countries you need to infiltrate into.

The developers at Atom claim that their ransomware will be **undetectable by AV software**, uses fast and strong encryption algorithm and supports multiple languages.

# Tox : The Ransomware Construction Kit

Available on the **Dark Web** since May 2017. You can use this tool to create a ransomware for Windows operating systems including all mobile devices which use the platform.

**The Tox presentation page says:**

> "We developed a virus which, once opened in a Windows OS, encrypts all the files. Once this process is completed, it displays a message asking to pay a ransom to a bitcoin address to unlock the files."

Anyone interested in TOX can subscribe to their service to create their own ransomware. The developers claim that through their kit, wannabe hackers can create ransomware in three "easy" steps:

* Deciding on the ransom amount
* Entering why they want to create the software
* Submitting Captcha.

**Is that Joker's smile we see there?** The developers benefit from a cut out of the ransom from victims like the Atom creators. They ensure that the payments are kept **anonymous** through Bitcoin and TOR.

**The developers also claim that the virus detection rate through Tox is very low.**

> "Tox-generated malware is compiled in MinGW and uses AES to encrypt client files via the Crypto++ library. The Microsoft CryptoAPI is used for key generation. â€“ McAfee"

Upon being initiated, Tox first downloads Curl and TOR client to work.
