# 📸 Personal Images  

**Fawkes** protects your personal images by making tiny, pixel-level changes that are invisible to the human eye. If someone tries to use these photos to build a facial recognition model, the **"cloaked"** images will teach the model a highly distorted version of what you actually look like.
